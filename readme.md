===============

Simple iOS app that loads a web page created to ease debugging a `uiWebView`. 

You'll need to [install XCode][3].

1. "Download Zip" or clone this project
2. Open XCode, open existing project, and choose the project you just downloaded.
3. Open WebViewAppDelegate.m and change the `urlString` to be the URL you want to test.
4. Run the app in the iOS Simulator.
5. Open Safari, Open the *Develop* Menu, Choose *iOS Simulator* and select your webview.
6. Safari Inspector will now be inspecting your uiWebView.
